Knowledge sharing and hacking sessions at [Nimble](https://nimblehq.co) ðŸ™Œ

## Introduction

Started in November 2016, Nimble Growth is an event now held every two months allowing the team to:

- Research new technologies and tools.
- Improve the internal engineering processes e.g. automating manual processes, decrease the time to start building a new application, 
speeding up our CI/CD pipelines.
- Work with team members they do not usually work with. This event is for all team members to join: developers, product managers, UX/UI designers, and operations associates.
- Have fun! ðŸ¥³

The repository contains all presentations for all sessions.

## How We Do It

### Timeline

![timeline](assets/timeline.png)

- Each session spans eight weeks consisting in 1) two weeks to validate projects and 2) six weeks to work on projects.
- Individuals must assemble a squad of 3-5 members and fill the roles of Product Manager, Team Lead, and Developers. The squad structure for Growth project is identical to client projects.
- Squads can dedicate one block of 0.5 days every two weeks, thus have a total of three blocks of 0.5 days over six weeks.
- All code is pushed to public repositories under the [Github organization of Nimble](https://github.com/nimblehq). 
- The session wraps up on Friday at the end of the six-week cycle for Presentation Day. We all gather for a show and tell time! Each project squad has a ten-minute presentation time to share their achievements, struggles and what they have learnt.s

### Project Board

- All projects are managed on Notion via a Kanban board.
- The board is used to 1) track the project statuses for each session and 2) submit new project ideas for future sessions.

## History

Over the years, the format of the event has continously changed to fit the team's needs and size:

- The event was first called Tech Wednesdays and was held twice a month on Wednesdays (hence the name ðŸ˜‰). It had a shorter duration of 0.5 day.
- In its second iteration, the event was renamed to Nimble Growth and was held every month. Each session lasted 1.5 days starting from Thursday mid-day until the following Friday (whole day).
- The current event format was launched in March 2020 and corresponds to Nimble Growth `2.0`. The same amount of time (1.5 days) is provided to each project but is spread over a period of six weeks instead of one block.
